      <h3>Here's a short timeline of Jimi's life:</h3>
      <ul>
    <li><b>1942</b> - Jimi Hendrix is born in Seattle, Washington.</li>
    <li><b>1957</b> - Finds an ukulele amongst the garbage that he was removing during a side job. It becomes his first stringed instrument.</li>
    <li><b>1958</b> - Jimi acquires his first acoustic guitar.</li>
    <li><b>1959</b> - Not soon after that he decides that in order to progress with his musical abilities an electric guitar was necessary. In that year, his father buys him his first electric guitar - a Supro Ozark 1560 S.</li>
    <li><b>1961</b> - After being caught by law enforcement officers twice for riding stolen cars, Jimi is given choice: either imprisonment or enlisting in the army. He chooses the latter. After completing eight weeks of basic training at Fort Ord, California, he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division and stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky</li>
    <li><b>1962</b> - Hendrix is granted an honorable discharge from the army on the basis of unsuitability. After that, he decided to fully pursue career in music and started playing locally around the US. </li>
        <li><b>1966</b> - The Jimi Hendrix Experience performs their first show. Enthusiastically received 15-minute performance at the Olympia theatre in Paris on October 18 marks the earliest known recording of the band.</li>
        <li><b>1967</b> - First album of the band, <i>Are You Experienced</i> surfaces. Realeased in the UK on May 12, it spents 33 weeks on the charts, peaking at number two - one spot below The Beatles' <i>Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.</i></li>
        <li><b>1969</b> - The Jimi Hendrix Experience breaks-up after recording such classic albums as <i>Axis: Bold as Love</i> and <i>Electric Ladyland</i>. By this time, Hendrix was the world's highest paid musician. He also headlined Woodstock Festival at the time with an electrifying performance, which spiked his popularity even moreso than before.</li>
        <li><b>1970</b> - On September 18, at the age of 27, one of the most influential guitarists of all-time was found dead in a hotel room in London. Although the details of his final hours and death are disputed, Hendrix spent much of his last day with Monika Dannemann, his girlfriend at the time. The post-mortem examination concluded that Hendrix aspirated his own vomit and died of asphyxia while intoxicated with barbiturates. Despite this, Hendrix's legacy lives on more than forty years after his death, and his music is as unique as it was in the 60s. </li>
